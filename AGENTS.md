## Development Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: Before creating any new files or features, always consult the `ARCHITECTURE.md` file to understand the project structure and determine the proper location and approach for adding new components. This ensures consistency with the project's architectural patterns and conventions.

### Side Project Principles

This is a **solo side project** - maintain these principles:

- **Minimal Approach**: Keep solutions simple and focused. Don't overengineer or overcomplicate
- **Code Quality**: Maintain best practices and clean architecture despite being a side project
- **Project Structure Alignment**: Follow the established multi-module architecture consistently
- **No Over-Engineering**: Avoid unnecessary abstractions, complex patterns, or premature optimizations
- **Practical Solutions**: Choose pragmatic approaches that balance simplicity with maintainability
